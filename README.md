The Questionnaire Finder is an interactive tool that allows users to explore datasets with available questionnaires from the UNHCR Microdata Library. This tool enables users to search questionnaires by various criteria, including country, region, population group, topic, representative sample, geographical coverage, collection, and language. The goal is to enhance the discoverability and accessibility of UNHCR Microdata Library questionnaires among global communities of practice, thereby facilitating their reuse and adaptation by governments and partner organizations conducting similar studies.
